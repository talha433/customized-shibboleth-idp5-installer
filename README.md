# Custom Shibboleth IdP Version 5 Installer for Users of Pakistan

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework for managing digital identities and controlling access to resources. It ensures that only authorized users have the right access to the right resources at the right time. IAM encompasses policies, technologies, and tools that manage users’ identities, authenticate their access, and authorize their actions within systems, networks, or applications. This framework improves security, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance by streamlining how access is granted and monitored.

### Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP)
Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP) is a prominent IAM tool used for federated identity management. Federated IAM allows users to authenticate with one identity across multiple applications or systems, which is essential in organizations where single sign-on (SSO) is necessary. Shibboleth IdP specifically uses SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) to authenticate and share identity attributes between organizations securely. Within IAM, Shibboleth IdP serves as a bridge between users and resources across different domains, enabling efficient and secure access management.

## Overview
The AAF Shibboleth IdP Installer is designed to automate the install of version 5 for the [Shibboleth IdP](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDP5/overview) on a dedicated server with one of the following supported operating systems;
* Rocky Linux
* Stream
* Redhat
* ORACLE Linux
* Ubuntu

For a full set of documentation and guidance on upgrading from Shibboleth version 4 please refer to the [AAF IdPv4 Installer Knowledge base](https://support.aaf.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/19000159910-shibboleth-idp-version-5-installer).

# Shibboleth IdP Version 5 Installer

### Actions undertaken during installation
The installation process will:

Optionally perform a yum -y update (system wide package upgrade). Please note that the installer uses yum or apt-get for the installation of all system components (except Jetty and Shibboleth IdP).

* Install all required dependencies (git, ansible, mariadb etc). With the previous step in mind, bootstrap will always use the latest versions of these packages.
* Create self signed keys for Jetty. These are for initial testing of the IdP and are replaced when further customising the Shibboleth IdP
* Install Jetty with Shibboleth IdP. Jetty runs on port 443 and optionally ports 80 and 8443 and creates the Shibboleth IdP web app context /idp.
* Install a MariaDB instance. A database is created (name: idp_db, user: idp_admin) with these schemas populated.
* Installs chrony for time synchronisation.
* Opens local firewall ports 443 and optionally ports 80 and 8443
* Optionally configures the IdP for integration with eduGAIN
* Optionally configures the IdP to enable various REFEDS specifications.

Here’s a complete guide to resolving the Python interpreter issue with Ansible by creating a new `ansible.cfg` file:

---

### Open terminal as a root (Linux Server). 

Run the following command:

```bash
sudo -s
```

Enter the root password.

---

### Grab the latest packages
Update and Upgrade the database of available packages:
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

---

### Ensure `Python` is Installed
First, confirm that Python 3 is installed. If it's not, install it with the following commands:

```bash
apt install python3 python3-pip python3-apt
```

---

### Change TimeZone w.r.t to your country:
```bash
timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Karachi 
```

---

### Set the IdP hostname, The public domain name of the IdP may be used in determined the entityID of the IdP.

(ATTENTION: Replace `idp.example.org` with your IdP Full Qualified `Domain Name` and `<HOSTNAME>` with the IdP hostname)

```bash
vim /etc/hosts
```

`<YOUR SERVER IP ADDRESS> idp.example.org <HOSTNAME>`
`hostnamectl set-hostname <HOSTNAME>`

---

### Installing `Ansible`
install Ansible run these commands

```bash
apt update
```
```bash
apt install ansible
```
---
### Variable
Ansible can also use an environment variable to specify the Python interpreter.

* Run the following command to set the environment variable:

   ```bash
   export ANSIBLE_PYTHON_INTERPRETER=/usr/bin/python3
   ```
* You can add this line to your .bashrc or .bash_profile to ensure it persists for future sessions:

   ```bash
   echo 'export ANSIBLE_PYTHON_INTERPRETER=/usr/bin/python3' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
---

### Upgrading Ansible
To upgrade an existing Ansible installation in this Python environment to the latest released version, simply add `--upgrade` to the command above:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user ansible
```

---

### Preparing the `bootstrap-v5.ini` File

1. **Download `bootstrap-v5.ini`:**

   For new installations, download the `bootstrap-v5.ini` file with the following command:

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talha433/customized-shibboleth-idp5-installer/main/bootstrap-v5.ini > bootstrap-v5.ini
   ```

2. **Edit `bootstrap-v5.ini`:**

   Open and configure the file using a text editor, for example:

   ```bash
   vi bootstrap-v5.ini
   ```

3. **Configure Required Sections:**

Press `i` to enter Insert Mode. Now you can type and edit the file.

   - **[main]**: Review, configure, and uncomment each field in this section.
   - **[ldap]**: If using LDAP, configure the settings here. TLS configuration can be updated post-bootstrap if needed.
   - **[logging, policy, and advanced]**: Carefully review and adjust settings as required, understanding the impact of each change.

Click the `Esc` key and then type `:wq!` to save and exit the configuration.

## Running the Installer

1. **Download and Prepare `bootstrap-v5.sh`:**

   Execute the following command to download and make the installer executable:

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talha433/customized-shibboleth-idp5-installer/main/bootstrap-v5.sh > bootstrap-v5.sh && chmod u+x bootstrap-v5.sh
   ```

   Ensure `bootstrap-v5.ini` is in the same directory as `bootstrap-v5.sh`.

2. **Run the Installer as Root:**

   Execute the installer script as the root user:

   ```bash
   ./bootstrap-v5.sh
   ```

This process will install and configure the server to operate as a Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP).

---

## Event Logging

The installer provides detailed information on each step undertaken during the setup process. If the installation completes successfully, this output can be disregarded. However, for future reference, all installer output is logged to:

```
cat /opt/shibboleth-idp5-installer/activity.log
```

---

## Allowing the installer to run again
In general you will never need to re-run the bootstrap-v5.sh script after it has completed creating the `/opt/shibboleth-v5-installer` directory. You should use the deploy or upgrade scripts instead.

If you must re-run bootstrap-v5.sh then you remove the lock file first. Note this will overwrite any previous installations.

```bash
rm /root/.lock-idp-bootstrap-v5 && ./bootstrap-v5.sh
```

The bootstrap-v5 process will now start over and attempt to install and configure your server to operate as a Shibboleth IdP.
